# Frakktur
Frakktur is a bold, monochrome web concept for an underground clothing brand. The project reflects the raw, minimal aesthetic of the brand — sharp edges, brutalist structure, and a stripped-back user experience.

## Design
Black and white. Nothing else.
A sharp, grid-based layout inspired by underground culture and brutalist web design. No distractions — pure focus on the products and the message.

## Development
Built with HTML5 and Tailwind CSS, keeping the codebase lean and maintainable.
Fully responsive, with clean transitions and a structure that works seamlessly across all devices. Designed for performance, clarity, and impact.

## Project Summary
This website is a digital extension of Frakktur's identity — raw, minimal, unapologetic. A foundation for product showcases, campaigns, and future e-commerce features.
